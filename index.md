## MY EXPERIENCE

### Cyncly / Sr Data Engineer (Oct 2023 â€“ June 2024)  

#### Computer-Vision/AI Features | Interior Design Software (Python, MongoDB, Azure Synapse, Service Bus, FastAPI/Flask, Data Lake, Vertex AI): 
As the newly formed A.I. Center of Excellence's first data engineer, I got to influence the team's strategic direction for its data operations as well as envision and implement mission-critical data-products and pipelines, with guidance from the team's Senior Architect, and in the process make hiring decisions to expand the team as well.    

Collaborated with AI teams to design data-models for a vector database, to optimize read-operations as needed by dependent REST APIs, while simultaneously contributing to the implementation of relevant APIs. 

Ideated and implemented an on-demand, idempotent batch data pipeline, hosted on Azure Synapse, empowering downstream teams with a self-serve tool, reducing time of data acquisition and rationalization by 90%. 

Collaborated with AI teams to experiment with different image-embedding generation approaches to be used for similarity matching, by leveraging vertex AI along with different off-the-shelf approaches such as grey-scaling. 

Implemented logging modules for convenient monitoring of highly complex data-transformation procedures, along with proposing incorporation of event-sourcing pattern into existing workflows for supporting debugging efforts.
